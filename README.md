# Song
This is a small project for practicing singing.

I created a breathing count exercise for my singing class. I needed a counter to practice with, so I implemented this code for that purpose.

You can run it as a Python script or an executable file (dist/count1.exe). It asks for an integer number, then displays a counter with green and yellow numbers.

Breathe in with the green numbers.

Breathe out with the yellow numbers.

Remember to breathe slowly, steadily, and smoothly.

I hope you enjoy it!
